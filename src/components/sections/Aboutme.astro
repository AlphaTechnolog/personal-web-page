      My name is <strong>Franklin Gabriel Guerra</strong>, but I am known online as <strong>AlphaTechnolog</strong>. I began learning programming at the age of 10 and am currently {yearsOld} years old. I am passionate about <strong>full-stack web application development</strong>, but even if I consider myself fullstack, I'm particularly interested mostly in <strong>backend development and cloud</strong>. However, I also consider myself proficient in <strong>systems programming</strong>, with some good experience in certain low levels languages.

      Many of my projects aim to <strong>solve everyday problems</strong> or explore various topics with the goal of <strong>expanding my skill set</strong>, as I believe that knowledge is best acquired through hands-on experimentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am an active member of the open-source community, having contributed to several projects, including recently a project called <strong>Cartero</strong>, a free and open-source alternative to Postman written in <strong>Rust and GTK</strong>. I have also created open-source projects that have fostered communities of contributors, such as <strong>Decay</strong>, a color theme that has been distributed across various applications and projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am venturing into <strong>game development</strong>, exploring new challenges and expanding my skill set in this exciting field.
